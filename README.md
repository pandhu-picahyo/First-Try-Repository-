# First-Try-Repository-

Hello, this is pandhu picahyo

Welcome to my GitHub account, and feel free to open or download the code

Hopefully my code can become your reference to your future coding career

I'm sorry if you found many errors in the code

I upload my raw code, and try to update or improving it overtime

I will say where the repository that have error or not in ReadMe.md at every repository

So don't forget to read the ReadMe.md at every repository

If you have any idea, sugestion, advice or question about code for me, feel free to contact me at p.picahyo@gmail.com

If you have any colaborative work, you can also contact me, i'm still looking for work, hehehe

Finally, really apreciate that you have read my writing until this point, thank you for reading this and my quote for you is :

Life is a choice, and choices are hard, 
Every thing you choose must have a consequence, 
So keep looking ahead and dreaming, 
and choose the choice according to what your heart says, 
Because whatever you choose, 
believe that God is good, 
and from every choice that we choose, 
we are asked by God to learn and grow

Hazrat Inayat Khan, in The Soul of Money by Lynne Twist, once said :

I asked for strength
and God gave me difficulties to make me strong.
I asked for wisdom
and God gave me problems to learn to solve.
I asked for prosperity
and God gave me a brain and brawn to work.
I asked for courage
and God gave me dangers to overcome.
I asked for love
and God gave me people to help.
I asked for favours
and God gave me opportunities.
I received nothing I wanted.
I received everything I needed.

that's enough from me, thank you, let's coding together XD
